## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Siddes:

- Instead, report privately to the project owner/maintainer.

Include:
- What you found (summary)
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact (what an attacker could do)
- Any proof-of-concept details (if safe)

## Supported versions
Only the latest main branch is supported.
