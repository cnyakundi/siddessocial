# Style Guide
**Updated:** 2026-01-09

## Naming
- Sides: public/friends/close/work
- Sets: viewer-private labels (Friends)
- Signals = Likes + Echoes + Replies
- Echo = repost action

## Copy
- Use standard CTAs: Follow / Join / Reply / Share
- Avoid invented verbs as primary CTAs (“Side in” is not a primary button)

## UI
- Chameleon UI = accent only (spine + tint)
- No layout changes per Side
- Chips: max 2 + overflow +N
