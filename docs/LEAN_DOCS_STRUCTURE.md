# Lean Docs Structure (Target)
**Updated:** 2026-01-26

This is the target “lean docs” shape. The repo can have more reference docs,
but these are the ones your brain should live in.

---

## Canonical (read/use constantly)
- `docs/README.md` — entry point
- `docs/CORE_LAWS.md`
- `docs/STATE.md`
- `docs/STABILIZATION_MANUAL.md`
- `docs/VIBE_CODING_PLAYBOOK.md`
- `docs/OVERLAYS_INDEX.md`

## Workflow / migration
- `docs/OVERLAY_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`
- `docs/PHASES.md`
- `docs/MIGRATION_PACK.md` (and any migration prompts required by checks)

## Product / launch
- `docs/SIDDES_BOOK.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GATES.md`
- `docs/GO_LIVE_MASTER_RUNBOOK.md`

## Reference (keep minimal; archive the rest)
- contracts that checks depend on (Inbox/Feed/Visibility/etc)
- security/privacy docs

## Archive
- `docs/_archive/` holds historical fix packs, old specs, duplicates, abandoned drafts.
